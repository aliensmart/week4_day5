"""Make a database to hold people (Users) and computers that they own..

Each User can have multiple Computers, but each Coputer can only have one User.

Users have:
    names, phone numbers, emails, and credit cards

Computers have:
    brand, model, year, RAM (integer, in GB) and 'disk' (storage, int in GB)

Create a `schema` file that makes our database, and an ORM subclass for each as well.

Create a `seed.py` file that will add 3 users and 3 computers to the database
